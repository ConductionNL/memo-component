Memo Component / Memo
-------

The memo component offers the generic option to let users create memos (notes) or resources (for example Common Ground resources). This functionality has been deliberately set up abstractly. Essentially, any user can create a memo about anything. This also offers the possibility to query the component for any resource and see if there are any memos for it.

Memos are in principle seen as internal to the organization and are emphatically not a channel of communication with the customer, there for is "contact moments" available.
