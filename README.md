# Memo Component / Memo

Description
-------

The memo component offers the generic option to let users create memos (notes) or resources (for example Common Ground resources). This functionality has been deliberately set up abstractly. Essentially, any user can create a memo about anything. This also offers the possibility to query the component for any resource and see if there are any memos for it.

Memos are in principle seen as internal to the organization and are emphatically not a channel of communication with the customer, there for is "contact moments" available.

Installation
----
We differentiate between two way's of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or an [helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on an development or production environment. 

#### Local installation
First make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your computer. Then clone the repository to a directory on your local machine through a [git command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (ui for git). If successful you can now navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in a command prompt and execute docker-compose up. 
```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the docker image and run the used containers and when seeing the log from the php container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections", u are ready to view the documentation at localhost on your preferred browser.

#### Instalation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a haven compliant commonground component this component is installable on kubernetes trough helm. The helm files can be found in the api/helm folder. For installing this component trough helm simply open your (still) favorite command line interface and run 
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in depth installation guide you can refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), it also contains a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world

Developers toolkit and technical information
